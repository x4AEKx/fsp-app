# Filtering sorting pagination application

React application:

- Client-side pagination: data displayed page by page, maximum 50 items per page, custom navigation to navigate through the pages.
- Sort by columns: when you click on a column name, the table rows are sorted in ascending order, when you click again, in descending order.
- Filtering: the component provides a text box into which the user can enter text and table rows whose data does not contain a substring, data that is hidden is entered. Re-filtering is performed for each change in the field value.
